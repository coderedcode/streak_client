Create resources:

  @pipeline = StreakClient::Pipeline.create(name: "Test", description: "T")
  @box = StreakClient::Box.create(@pipeline.pipelineKey, {name: "Test Box"})

Load existing resources:

  @pipelines = StreakClient::Pipeline.all
  @box = StreakClient::Box.find(@box.boxKey)
  @boxes_in_a_pipeline = pipelines.first.boxes

Edit resources:

  @box.name = "New Name"
  @box.save!

Delete resources:

  StreakClient::Pipeline.delete(@pipeline.pipelineKey)
